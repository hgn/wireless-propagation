\slidetitle{Disclaimer}{Disclaimer}
\bi
	\item The initial purpose of this work was to verify and
	      check the implementation of the \textit{Nakagami Fading Model}
		  in ns-3. At the half of the work I realized that the generated
		  material is a good starting point for path loss in general.
		  Especially to develop intuition how path loss influence the Wireless
		  simulation at the whole. How model knobs influences the
		  characteristic of the channel, etc.

	\item The complete work is public available and can be used for further
	      investigation:\newline
	      \verb+git clone http://git.jauu.net/wireless-propagation.git+

	\item Suggestion, enhancement or critic is highly welcome!

	\item A Wireless channel is unsteady and lossy
	\item Wireless network simulators requires a model of this characteristic
	\item Most relevant parameters for wave propagation:
	\be
		\item Attenuation
		\item Slow Fading (shadowing)
		\item Fast Fading (multipath scattering)
	\ee
	\item For the Symbol/Bit Error Rate (BER) the modulation scheme is crucial

	\item The 1st Fresnel (pronounced Fray-nell) zone is a spheroid
	      with its center along the shortest distance between antennas.
	\item If there are no obstacles in the space forming 60\%
	      of this distance, propagation characteristics are said to be
		  the same as in free space
	\item Ensure line of sight between the transceivers
	\item If a Fresnel zone is not established, multipath interference will occur
	\item The Fresnelzone depends on the frequency: $>F \rightarrow{} <b$
	\item \begin{math} F_n = \sqrt{\frac{n \lambda d_1 d_2}{d_1 + d_2}} \end{math},
	      \begin{math} \lambda = \frac{v}{f}\end{math}

\bi
	\item Friis is a transmission equation gives the power received by one antenna
	      under idealized conditions.
	\item Formula:\\\vspace{1cm}
	\begin{large}
	\begin{math}
	\frac{P_r}{P_t} = G_t G_r (\frac{\lambda}{4 \pi R} )^2
	\end{math}\\\vspace{1cm}
	\end{large}
	\begin{small}
	$P_r$ Receiving power (dBm)\\
	$P_t$ Transmitter power (dBm)\\
	$G_t$ Antenna Gain Transmitter (dBi/dBd)\\
	$G_r$ Antenna Gain Receiver (dBi/dBd)\\
	$\lambda$ Wavelength (meter, \dots)\\
	$R$ Distance between the nodes (meter, \dots)\\
	\end{small}
	\item But: ideal conditions are never achieved\footnote{one exception
	      is satellite communications when there is negligible atmospheric absorption}

	\item Friis at long distance tends to accurate prediction
	\item The single line-of-sight path is seldom the only means of propagation
	\item The two-ray ground reflection model considers both
	      the direct path and a ground reflection path
	\item \begin{math} P_r(d) = \frac{P_t G_t G_r h_t^2 h_r^2}{d^4 L} \end{math}

		\item $L$: 1

	\item Increased power loss compared to Free Space Model
	\item No good results for small distance $\rightarrow$ use Free Space Model
	      for near distances
